# PixiJS Playground

A small project for experimenting with PixiJS and learning how 2D rendering works in the browser.

## What This Is

A simple sandbox to explore:

- Drawing shapes  
- Loading sprites  
- Animating with the ticker  
- Working with containers  
- Handling basic interaction  
- Understanding transparency and layering  

This project is purely for learning and experimentation.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
